# Lego's Life of George

Legoâ€™s Life of George is a game where an image is displayed on the screen for a number of seconds before being blanked. The player of the game then has to construct the shape from Lego blocks from memory. The player photographs the finished blocks and their computer automatically compares the brick pattern to the original image. Similar problems are found in many image processing applications, for example the colour segmentation of real world objects; colour data matrix reading. A colour data matrix has the advantage over conventional blank and white versions in that more information can be stored for a given pattern.

In this project I wrote a function in MATLAB that will automatically read a colour pattern image and return an array that represents the colour pattern.
